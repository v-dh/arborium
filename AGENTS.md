# AGENTS.md

This file defines how coding agents should behave in this repository.

## Priorities

1. Keep code simple, explicit, and maintainable.
2. Fix root causes, avoid temporary band-aids.
3. Preserve user changes, never revert unrelated edits.

## Workflow

1. Read this file at task start.
2. Prefer `just` recipes for common tasks.
3. Before committing code, always run `just format` and `just lint` and fix any failures.
4. Before handoff, run relevant checks for touched code.

## Commands

- Format: `just format`
- Format check: `just format-check`
- Lint: `just lint`
- Test: `just test`
- Run app: `just run`
- Run HTTP daemon: `just run-httpd`

## Rust Rules

- Do not use `unwrap()` or `expect()` in non-test code. In test modules, allow them with `#[allow(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used)]`.
- Use `arbor_core::ResultExt` / `arbor_core::OptionExt` for `.context()` instead of ad-hoc `.map_err()`.
- Use `SessionId` and `WorkspaceId` newtypes (from `arbor_core::id`) instead of raw `String`.
- Use clear error handling with typed errors (`thiserror`/`anyhow` where appropriate).
- Keep modules focused and delete dead code instead of leaving it around.

## Code Organization

- Split large files by domain. Target ~800 lines per file max.
- Use `pub(crate)` for items shared within a crate. Apply to fields, methods, and free functions.
- Use `pub(crate) use module::*` re-exports to keep call sites clean after splitting.
- When extracting code to a new file, ensure all struct fields are `pub(crate)` (not private) so the parent module can access them.

## Feature Flags

- `arbor-gui` features: `ssh`, `mosh`, `mdns` (default: all enabled).
- `arbor-httpd` features: `mdns` (default: enabled).
- `arbor-core` features: `ssh`, `mosh` (propagated from GUI).
- Gate optional modules/functions with `#[cfg(feature = "...")]`.
- Use `dep:crate_name` syntax for optional dependency features.
- `mosh` implies `ssh` — features are hierarchical.

## Workspace Dependencies

All dependency versions live in the root `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.dependencies]`. Subcrate `Cargo.toml` files use `{ workspace = true }`. Never hardcode a version in a subcrate.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Missing `pub(crate)` on extracted items**: When moving structs, enums, or functions from `main.rs` to submodules, every field and method that was previously accessible needs `pub(crate)`.
- **Unused imports after extraction**: After moving code out of a file, clean up `use` statements in the source file — the compiler will flag these.
- **Duplicate definitions**: When splitting code, ensure a function/type exists in exactly one place. Check both the source and destination files.
- **Test module lint attributes**: Test modules need both `#[allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]` and `#[allow(clippy::expect_used)]` since the workspace denies both.
- **Forgetting `#[cfg(feature)]` on imports**: When gating a module with a feature flag, also gate its `use` import and any code that references its types.

## Git Rules

- Treat `git status` / `git diff` as read-only context.
- Do not run destructive git commands.
- Do not amend commits unless explicitly asked.
- Only create commits when the user asks.

## Changelog

- Use `git-cliff` for changelog generation.
- Config file: `cliff.toml`
- Commands:
  - `just changelog`
  - `just changelog-unreleased`
  - `just changelog-release <version>`
